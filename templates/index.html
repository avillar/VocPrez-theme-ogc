    <h1>Welcome to the OGC Definitions Server - Profiles Register</h1>
    <p>This version of the OGC Definitions Server is for the purpose of publishing "Interoperability Profiles" of OGC and related standards</p>
    <p>This register provides a common consistent view of such profiles and any relationships between them.</p>
    <p>For each profile it provides access to a range of resources needed to implement them via either direct content-negotiation using the profile identifier, or via a "proxy profile" which offers this service on behalf of standards that do not offer implementation resources directly using the standard's own URI.. </p>
    <p>The "alternate profiles" view provided for each resource will provide a complete list of the available resources per profile. <p>
    <p>See the <a href="http://ogc.org/def-server">Definitions Server About Page</a> for more information about the OGC Definitions Server.</p>
