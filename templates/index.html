    <h1>Welcome to the OGC Definitions Server</h1>
    <p>The OGC Definitions Server publishes a range of resources managed by the OGC, and identified by unique stable web addresses (IRIs or URIs). These are determined through a set of policies managed by the OGC Naming Authority and managed through normal operational processes.</p>
    <p>The knowledge graph behind the definitions server is flexible and extensible, and the OGC will continue to register new terms and improve the cross-linkages between terms.</p>
    <p>Definitions are made available in an interoperable form using the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/">SKOS vocabulary</a> (or "taxonomy") model in both human- and machine-readable forms.</p>
    <p>Some definitions have richer information models with alternative profiles of the content available.</p>
    <p>Vocabularies are managed in sets called "ConceptSchemes", and definitions can usually be accessed individually as "Concepts" or via the containing set.</p>
    <p>The "alternate profiles" will provide a complete list of the available resources per definition.<p>
    <p>See the <a href="http://ogc.org/def-server">Definitions Server About Page</a> for more information about the OGC Definitions Server.</p>
